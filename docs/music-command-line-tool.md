## Intro

cmajor is a command line tool to help you trawl through various music theory concepts. Examples are below

Most of it is actually just basic set theory. But... still useful.

KEY
  M = Major
  m = Minor
  P = Perfect
  NOT SURE = Diminished
  + = Augmented
  # = Sharp
  b = Flat

### Language

cmajor will be written in either Scheme, or C.
Scheme because I want to learn it,
C because I want to learn it.

I'm leaning towards scheme for teh lulz and because I don't think
think we need C for something that is very simple in a
higher level language. In fact, a lot of this would
be down right painful in C. So yeah,
Scheme it is!...Sorry C :(
